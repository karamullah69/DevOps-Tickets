# CI/CD Pipeline with AWS CloudFormation

This project sets up a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CloudFormation, allowing for automated deployments of application code through different stages (Dev, QA, UAT, Prod) with manual approvals.

## Architecture

The CI/CD pipeline consists of the following components:

- **Infrastructure**: AWS CloudFormation is used to provision the necessary resources, such as CodeCommit repository, ECR repository, and IAM roles.
- **Batch Job Components**: AWS Batch is used for running batch job components. Additional configuration and settings need to be added according to specific requirements.
- **Code Deployment**: Application code is sourced from a GitHub repository and deployed to an ECR repository.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- An AWS account with appropriate permissions to create resources and configure IAM roles.
- AWS CLI installed and configured with your AWS account credentials.
- (Optional) AWS CDK or Terraform installed if you choose to use infrastructure as code frameworks.

## Deployment Steps

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git

Feel free to customize the README.md file as per your project requirements, including adding additional sections or information specific to your project.
